# And we're done
It's been a blast, thank you to everyone who transcribed, you're the true GOATs!  
Final csv export files are in this repo, in both rehashed and original format   

 - We collected a total of 50885 transcriptions in just hours / days
 - We got confident on 1453 puzzlepieces, 1096 of them being unique
 - Our database on puzzlepieces to transcribe contains a total 26336 images
 - The person with the most transcriptions transcribed 184 images
 - Every person has transcribed an average count of 10.1543 images

We're looking forward to the next community based puzzle - next time we'll kick that off even earlier

You all ROCK!

# about
> spreadsheetstiny 2: corridors of sleeplessness

### PURPOSE:
The purpose of this site is to provide the most accurate database of puzzle piece transcriptions for anyone to use. Download link below.

### HOW DOES THIS WORK: 
Each image is transcribed several times by different people. Identical transcriptions increases the confidence that the transcription is accurate. Once the accuracy of an image's transcription has reached a high confidence rating, it will be added to our table of verified results. 

# development
## ez mode
requriements:
- [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)
- docker
- docker-compose


```bash
# allow the directory to load the custom commands
direnv allow
```
and then you can use the `pz` command to run the commands on a built version of the current code:

```bash
# setup dev environment files
pz setupenv
# build the current dev version
pz lbuild
# start the dev stack
pz lup
# stop the dev stack
pz ldown
# build and reload  the dev stack (also starts if not running yet)
pz lreload
# view logs of running service
pz llogs
# attach to logs and follow running service
pz llogsf
# execute a command inside a container
pz lexec $docker_compose_service $commands
## so if you wanna run a shell inside the db it would look like this
pz lexec db bash
# run an arbitrary docker-compose command on the dev cluster
pz lcmd $command
```

if you do not want to mount the local `/src` directory into the running docker container, you can omit the prepended `l` on commands like so:

```bash
# setup dev environment files
pz setupenv
# build the current dev version
pz build
# start the dev stack
pz up
# stop the dev stack
pz down
# build and reload  the dev stack (also starts if not running yet)
pz restart
# view logs of running service
pz logs
# attach to logs and follow running service
pz logsf
# execute a command inside a container
pz exec $docker_compose_service $commands
## so if you wanna run a shell inside the db it would look like this
pz exec db bash
# run an arbitrary docker-compose command on the dev cluster
pz cmd $command
```

## manual setup
### Docker
```bash
# Dev
docker-compose -f build && docker-compose up -d

# Prod
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

### local python
Python 3.7 or newer.

Install Django. Anything 3.0.x.
``` bash
pip install Django
pip install mysqlclient
# OR
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup the database
python manage.py migrate

# Run the web server
python manage.py runserver 8000
```


# TODO:
- [ ] Needs a approval process for submitted images...
- [ ] The 19 lore puzzle pieces should be filtered out of the results
- [ ] Dockerize app and figure out deployment
- [ ] update this readme lmao

# Rough guide to spinning this up as a dev server from scratch. Is missing notes on lup (mount local dir) and general iteration loop
Assuming a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 host. This also works in Win10 2004 with WSL2 docker and Docker for Desktop

From the ~ directory, here assuming a non-root user

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt upgrade  
```
Restart services automatically and keep local versions when asked  

Some of these upgrades require reboot, let's do that now  
```sudo reboot  

sudo apt install direnv  
sudo apt install docker  
sudo apt install docker-compose  

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  
```

Create .vimrc  
```
vi .vimrc  
set noexpandtab  
set background=dark  
```

Add to the very end of .bashrc  
```
vi .bashrc  
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"  
LS_COLORS=$LS_COLORS:'di=1;44:' ; export LS_COLORS  
```

Log out and back in  

Minimal git setup  
```
git config --global user.name "*Your name*"  
git config --global user.email *Your email*  
git config --global core.autocrlf input  
```

If you just want to play with it and you don't intend to submit code:  
```
git clone git@github.com:Corridors-of-Time-Transcription/puzzlepieces.git  
```

If you DO want to submit code and PRs, please:  
- Fork to your own repo  
- On your dev server, create keys
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o
cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Go to your github settings, SSH and GPG keys, and set this as a "New SSH key". Title could be "Puzzle Test Server" or something descriptive.  

Get the URL for the develop branch (NOT master) from your github fork, "Clone with SSH", and  
```
git clone *URL github gave you*  
cd puzzlepieces  
git remote add upstream git@github.com:Corridors-of-Time-Transcription/puzzlepieces.git  
git remote -v  
```

Once you have the code from either git:
```
cd ~/puzzlepieces 
direnv allow  
```

Now edit docker files depending on how you'll access your machine. Yes we know our docker routing is shonky. We invite help! Get in touch with @ebuch.  

So, figure out how you access your dev server. If it's through localhost, no changes needed. If it's through another IP or a name, you'll need that IP or that name, and we'll tell docker about it. Notably that's what you use to get to it, which may not be its local IP.  

```
cd ops  
vi docker-compose.dev.yml  
```

Find "VIRTUAL_HOST=localhost" and change to "VIRTUAL_HOST=*whatever-IP-or-name-you-use-to-connect*"  

Rinse repeat for docker-compose.dev.local.yml  

Environment files next. Same thing here, docker help appreciated  
```
cp db-dev.env.example db-dev.env  
cp production.env.example production.env  
cp development.env.example development.env  

cd ..  
git update-index --assume-unchanged ops/docker-compose.dev.local.yml  
git update-index --assume-unchanged ops/docker-compose.dev.yml  
```

Back to puzzlepieces and spin this up. We're using pz, which is just a little script wrapped around docker  

```
pz build  
pz up  
```

You should be able to get to http://*your-machine*, and from CLI  ```docker ps``` should show you three containers  

Syncing with upstream master, assuming your own fork and a fork and branch model 

```
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop 
git push  
```

And get the changes into your running docker instances  

```
pz build  
pz up
```

Similar for "master" which is where the live version was going to live.


If you have PRs to contribute, not that we do this now any more, it'd be:

```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b *new-feature-branch*
```

Lots of coding occurs, testing, etc

```
git commit
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout *new-feature-branch*
git rebase develop
git push --set-upstream origin *new-feature-branch*
```

The DB for the dev environment is named "puzzlepieces", the user is "puzzler" and the password "puzzling"
